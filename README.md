# Books-App-UI
Prototype of a books app that allows users to easily buy and sell used books.
Design a mobile app that allows users to easily buy and sell used books.

 

Expected approach:

Define facts like what is the scope of the app, who would be the audience etc. If you are not certain of some facts, you'll need to make a few assumptions on your own and make a solution accordingly.

Break down the problem into parts (Define the different types of users, what actions can a user take and what this would result in).

Think of an end to end solution for different kinds of possible users for this app. Think about what elements you think should be there on any given app screen and what would be the user journey. 
Hint: You may use a pencil and paper to make app screens (Wireframing) & to make user flows. 

Expected output:

Documenting the problem & a well thought through detailed solution (assumptions, facts, and your thought process)

Screens & Information architecture (What options will be shown where, how will one screen be linked to the other)

User flows for different scenarios and user types
